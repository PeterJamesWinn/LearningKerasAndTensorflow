# LearningKerasAndTensorflow

Some exercises to learn Keras and Tensor flow. The code here loosely follows the teaching on the free Udacity course accessable from tensorflow.org, and also includes some exercises borrowed from Justin Johnson's lectures on Deep Learning for Vision, delivered at Michigan University, although these latter are originally set in PyTorch so require some adaptation for Keras.  

FashionMNIST_DenseOnly_ComparedTo_CNNmodels   - kera implementation of a dense layer with Relu model and a CNN with Relu model for analysing the fashion MNIST data set. 
KerasTensorFlow_LearningLinearFunction_NoActivation - using dense layer(s) to create a simple linear model regression. 
TensorManipulationInTensorFlow  - practicing manipulating tensor flow tensors - after the course work for Justin Johnson's Deep Learning course at Michigan.
