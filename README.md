# LearningKerasAndTensorflow

Some exercises to learn Keras and Tensor flow. The code here loosely follows the teaching on the free Udacity course accessable from tensorflow.org, and also includes some exercises borrowed from Justin Johnson's lectures on Deep Learning for Vision, delivered at Michigan University, although these latter are originally set in PyTorch so require some adaptation for Keras.
